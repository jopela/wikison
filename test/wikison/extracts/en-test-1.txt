Peercoin (code: PPC), also known as PPCoin and Peer-to-Peer Coin is the first 
cryptocurrency based on an implementation of a combined proof-of-stake 
(PoS)/proof-of-work system (PoW).  Peercoin (PPC) was created by software 
developer Sunny King (who also developed the cryptocurrency Primecoin) in 
August 2012. Peercoin was inspired by Bitcoin, and it shares much of the 
source code and technical implementation of Bitcoin. The Primecoin source code 
is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license.
As of 8 November 2013, one Peercoin had a value of approximately 0.59 USD, 
making Peercoin the third largest cryptocurrency with a money supply valued at 
12 million USD.


== Transactions ==
A peer-to-peer network handles Peercoin's transactions.


=== Addresses ===
Payments in the Peercoin network are made to addresses, which are based on 
digital signatures. 


=== Confirmations ===
Transactions are recorded in the Peercoin blockchain.


== Distinguishing features ==


=== Proof-of-stake ===
Peercoin's major distinguishing feature is that it uses 
proof-of-stake/proof-of-work hybrid system. 
The proof-of-stake system also has other effects (listed below).


=== Proof-of-work ===
SHA-256. For each 16x increase in the network, the PoW block reward is halved.


=== Energy efficiency ===
Peercoin's proof-of-stake system was developed to address the high energy 
consumption of Bitcoin. 


=== Steady inflation ===
Peercoin is designed so that it will theoretically experience a steady 1% 
"decentralized" inflation per year 
(inflation for each user is proportional to the number of coins they have), 
yielding an unlimited number of coins. 


=== Deflationary aspect ===
The Peercoin transaction fee is fixed at 0.01 PPC for every transaction; 
however, the fee does not go to miner's income, but rather destroyed in order 
to offset the inflation caused by the POS minting process.


=== Transaction fees ===
It is designed so that variable transaction fees are removed in favor of one 
chosen by the network (currently 0.01 PPC). 


== Money supply ==
There are 20.5 million Peercoins in existence, as of October 1, 2013, with a 
total value of $7.9 million USD.


== Economics ==
Peercoin operates according to a free price system. Prices are determined in a decentralized fashion by trades that occur as a result of sellers' asking prices matching buyers' bid prices as a result of subjective value judgement in a market economy.


== Issues/controversies ==


=== Centralized check pointing ===
Peercoin is not truly a completely decentralized currency as it still requires 
centralized check pointing to avoid several issues.

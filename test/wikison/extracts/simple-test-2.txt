This is a more complex test case wiki-like article. It contains some character
that might be "difficult" to parse.


== Section with many words in title ==
this section contains some text and some subsections.


=== Subsection
This subsection can contains `many` subsections but we will stop it here.
See the wiki creole syntax definition for more info.


=== Money
One of the most important thing in life is $$$. This bring me to the ultimate
question of why oh why did I not buy the bitcoins i wanted to buy while
they were at 200.0$ usd. Look at them now, I'm poor and they are worth 500.0$
usd. 

== A section can contain only subsection


=== Super duper
Energy efficiency. the big fat chick stunk and like beef and candy depression.
I see her sick, maybe I'm embarassed.

The zoo is all I believe in. I just want to do some soft algebra.

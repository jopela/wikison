# Wikison 

Get json articles from any (Media)Wiki project.

## Features

Wikison is a clojure wrapper around the /w/api.php MediaWiki API that convert
a wiki page into a json document.

+ Works across *all* MediaWiki backed projects (e.g: wikipedia.org,
wikivoyage.org, species.wikimedia.org and even your own wiki's !).
+ Parses the wiki-creole article content for you and produces a 
tree-like, hierarchy-preserving json document (e.g: with abstract at the root
of the document and sections as childs).
+ Can be used as a clojure library or as a .jar stand-alone application that
takes a list of wiki url as input and print the json documents on stdout.

## Known issues
There is a temporary work-around implemented by adding a single "\n" to the 
wiki-creole text returned by the mediawiki API. This changes nothing to the
real content except by adding an empty newline in the last section of every
article. This is a bug in the context-free grammar itself and will fixed in a
later release.
